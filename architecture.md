Defining the Architecture

Since this is a multiplayer zombie apocalypse survival game built with Three.js, we need an architecture that’s modular, scalable, and follows your rules. The game will have a client-server model, with Three.js handling client-side rendering and a Node.js server managing the game state. We’ll use Cursor to streamline development, leveraging its code generation and refactoring tools.

Core Components
Let’s identify the minimal, necessary components to start building:

Game Engine: Runs the game loop and coordinates systems.
Player: Manages player state and input.
Zombie: Controls zombie AI and behavior.
Structure: Handles player-built defenses or structures.
Rendering System: Renders the scene with Three.js.
Input System: Processes inputs (desktop and mobile).
Network System: Syncs data with the server.
These components cover the essentials for a prototype. Additional features like upgrades or advanced UI can come later, ensuring we don’t overcomplicate the initial build.

Directory Structure
A clear directory structure is key to mapping out the game and enforcing separation of concerns. Here’s a lean outline to start with, reflecting the core components:

game/
├── src/                         # Client-side code
│   ├── components/              # Core game entities
│   │   ├── GameEngine.js        # Game loop and system coordination
│   │   ├── Player.js            # Player state and behavior
│   │   ├── Zombie.js            # Zombie AI and state
│   │   └── Structure.js         # Player-built structures
│   ├── systems/                 # Systems operating on components
│   │   ├── RenderingSystem.js   # Three.js rendering
│   │   ├── InputSystem.js       # Input handling (keyboard, mouse, touch)
│   │   └── NetworkSystem.js     # Client-server communication
│   ├── assets/                  # Game assets
│   │   ├── textures/            # Textures for models
│   │   └── models/              # 3D models
│   ├── config/                  # Dynamic settings
│   │   └── GameConfig.js        # Game-wide settings (e.g., tick rate)
│   └── main.js                  # Entry point
├── public/                      # Static files
│   ├── index.html               # HTML template
│   └── styles.css               # Basic styling
├── server/                      # Server-side code
│   ├── index.js                 # Server setup (Node.js + Socket.io)
│   └── gameState.js             # Centralized game state
└── package.json                 # Dependencies and scripts
Explanation:

src/components/: Each file is a single source of truth for an entity’s state and behavior (e.g., Player.js handles position, health).
src/systems/: Systems process components (e.g., RenderingSystem.js updates the Three.js scene).
src/assets/: Stores textures and models, loaded dynamically to avoid hard-coding paths.
src/config/: Centralizes settings (e.g., player speed) to keep the game dynamic.
server/: Manages the game state and networking, ensuring scalability.
This structure is minimal yet extensible. As we scale, we can add directories like utils/ for helpers or ui/ for interface components.

Question: Does this structure align with your vision? Should we include additional directories (e.g., for UI or utilities) now, or keep it lean for the prototype?
