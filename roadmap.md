Development Roadmap
Hereâ€™s a phased plan to build and scale the game, ensuring each component is necessary and the architecture grows organically:

Phase 1: Prototype (Single-Player Core)
Goal: Build a basic game with a player, zombies, and simple structures.
Tasks:
Set up Three.js scene in RenderingSystem.js.
Implement GameEngine.js with a game loop.
Create Player.js with basic movement (WASD or arrows).
Add Zombie.js with simple AI (move toward player).
Build Structure.js for placing a basic wall.
Handle inputs in InputSystem.js (desktop only for now).
Outcome: A playable single-player demo.
Phase 2: Multiplayer Foundation
Goal: Add networking for multiplayer support.
Tasks:
Set up server/index.js with Socket.io.
Implement NetworkSystem.js to send/receive player inputs.
Centralize game state in server/gameState.js.
Add client-side prediction and server reconciliation.
Outcome: Players can join and move in the same world.
Phase 3: Feature Expansion
Goal: Enhance gameplay with more features.
Tasks:
Add mobile input support in InputSystem.js.
Expand Zombie.js with varied behaviors.
Enhance Structure.js with multiple types (e.g., traps).
Introduce basic UI (e.g., health bar).
Outcome: A richer, cross-platform experience.
Phase 4: Optimization and Scaling
Goal: Ensure performance and scalability.
Tasks:
Profile rendering and network performance.
Optimize asset loading (e.g., lazy-load textures).
Implement spatial partitioning for large worlds.
Outcome: Smooth gameplay with many players.
Phase 5: Polish and Release
Goal: Finalize the game.
Tasks:
Add sound effects and polish UI.
Balance gameplay (e.g., zombie difficulty).
Test and deploy.
Outcome: A complete, playable game.
